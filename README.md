# Quatrain
Quatrain(Question Answering for Patch Correctness Evaluation), a supervised learning approach that exploits a deep NLP model to classify the
relatedness of a bug report with a patch description.

### Dataset
* **BugReport:** Bug reports for Defects4j, Bugsjar, Bears. Structured as `bug-id $$ bug report summary $$ bug report description`.
  1. bug report summary: title for bug issue  
  2. bug report description: detailed description for bug issue
* **CommitMessage:** Commit messages written by developer or generated by CodeTrans. Structured as `bug-id: commit message` in json file.
* **bugreport_patch.txt:** Pairs of Bug report & Commit message. Structured as `bug-id $$ bug report summary $$ bug report description $$ patchId $$ patch description $$ label`

### run.py
* validate_hypothesis: investigating the semantic similarity between the bug report and patch descriptions. 
* predict_leave1out_10group: 10-group cross validation to evaluate the performance of approaches. Parameters as follows:
  1. algorithm: QA NLP model
  2. comparison: '' for RQ1 and RQ2.1. 'ASE','BATS','PATCHSIM' for RQ3. 
  3. Sanity: False or True. check sanity for RQ2.2
  4. QualityOfMessage: quality of input for RQ2.3
